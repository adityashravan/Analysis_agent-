## 🔥 Breaking Changes (3)

### Overview Table

| Severity   | Component                       | Type       | K8s Components                            |
|:-----------|:--------------------------------|:-----------|:------------------------------------------|
| 🟠 HIGH     | RMT (Repository Mirroring Tool) | breaking   | kubelet, container runtime                |
| 🟠 HIGH     | 389 Directory Server            | breaking   | authentication services, external DNS     |
| 🟡 MEDIUM   | glibc                           | behavioral | container runtimes, application workloads |

### Detailed Analysis

#### 1. RMT (Repository Mirroring Tool) 🟠

**Change Type**: breaking

**Impact Severity**: HIGH

**Description**:

SMT (Subscription Management Tool) has been removed and replaced by RMT. This change affects systems that were using SMT for repository management, as RMT requires different configuration and usage patterns. Existing setups relying on SMT will break as they will not be able to manage repositories or register systems without migrating to RMT.

**Affected Kubernetes Components**:
- kubelet
- container runtime

---

#### 2. 389 Directory Server 🟠

**Change Type**: breaking

**Impact Severity**: HIGH

**Description**:

389 Directory Server replaces OpenLDAP as the LDAP directory service. Existing Kubernetes workloads that depend on OpenLDAP for authentication or directory services will fail to function as expected after the upgrade, requiring migration to 389 Directory Server.

**Affected Kubernetes Components**:
- authentication services
- external DNS

---

#### 3. glibc 🟡

**Change Type**: behavioral

**Impact Severity**: MEDIUM

**Description**:

The glibc package has been updated to version 2.38, which introduces changes in memory management and threading behavior. Applications built against older versions may experience compatibility issues, particularly those that rely on specific memory allocation patterns.

**Affected Kubernetes Components**:
- container runtimes
- application workloads

---

## ☸️ Kubernetes Impact Analysis (3)

### 1. kube-apiserver

**Impact Description**:

Kubernetes workloads relying on OpenLDAP for authentication will fail to authenticate users, leading to access issues.

**Required Actions**:

1. Migrate authentication from OpenLDAP to 389 Directory Server
2. Update API server configuration to point to the new directory service.

---

### 2. kubelet

**Impact Description**:

Kubernetes nodes that rely on SMT for repository management will fail to pull necessary container images and updates, leading to node failures.

**Required Actions**:

1. Migrate repository management from SMT to RMT
2. Update the repository configuration files to use RMT.

---

### 3. containerd

**Impact Description**:

Applications running in containers that depend on specific glibc behaviors may experience crashes or unexpected behavior due to the updated glibc version.

**Required Actions**:

1. Test and validate all containerized applications against the new glibc version
2. Rebuild containers if necessary.

---

## 🛠️ Mitigation Steps (3)

### Action Plan

#### Pre-Upgrade Actions

**Step 1** 🟠 *HIGH Priority*

Migrate from SMT to RMT by configuring RMT according to the documentation. Use 'zypper install rmt' to install RMT and follow the setup instructions in /usr/share/doc/rmt/README.

#### Post-Upgrade Actions

**Step 2** 🟠 *HIGH Priority*

Migrate LDAP configurations from OpenLDAP to 389 Directory Server by exporting data from OpenLDAP and importing it into 389 Directory Server. Update Kubernetes configurations to point to the new directory server.

**Step 3** 🟡 *MEDIUM Priority*

Test applications for compatibility with glibc 2.38. Rebuild any applications that may have compatibility issues with the new glibc version.

---

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations (2)

1. Plan for a thorough testing phase post-upgrade to identify any compatibility issues with existing Kubernetes workloads.

2. Ensure that all Kubernetes components are compatible with the new versions of system libraries and services introduced in SLES 15 SP7.
